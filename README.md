Decision Tree basic implementation with tiny usage example and tests. 
(draft version)
- arithmetic operations covered by ProcessNode
- standard relations covered by DecisionNode
  
Future:
- implement more sophisticated tests, for example complex mixed decision tree
- pass the result to next node or pass it to global storage and the next node can get the parent node result
- fix warnings
- implement LogicalNode to doing logical operation between proper data types
