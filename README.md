Decision Tree basic implementation with tiny usage example and tests. 
(draft version)
- arithmetic operations covered by ProcessNode
- standard relations covered by DecisionNode
  
Future:
- implement more sophisticated tests, for example complex mixed decision tree
- implement tests for RepositoryStorageHelper
- pass the result to next node or pass it to global storage and the next node can get the parent node result
- implement tests for Comparator
- in console log replace the Add with arithmetic operator '+'
- fix warnings
