Decision Tree basic implementation with tiny usage example and tests. (draft version)
- arithmetic operations covered by ProcessNode
- standard relations covered by DecisionNode
  
Future:
- implement contains
- implement more sophisticated tests
- implement tests for RepositoryStorageHelper
- put the current result into each node into public Dictionary<Guid, IResponse<T>> ResultMap { get; set; }
